## How to Use the Neighborhood Map
The Neighborhood Map shows you locations in Rome, Italy that are visited within the book, "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown.

In the dark blue menu panel, you can see a list of all the location names visible on the map in the middle. You can use the drop down box to filter the locations by categories. You can also click a location in the list and it will open an information window on the map.

If you are using a mobile device, their is a menu icon above the map that will toggle the left side panel to allow you to see the list of locations and categories. To remove the left side panel, just click outside of the area.

The information windows includes the name of the location, their phone number if listed, and their address so you can visit (Courtesy of the Foursquare API).
